### Function Declaration
Syntax:
```javascript
function() {

}
```
**can be called anywhere**
**only visible inside of a block**

### Function Expressions
Syntax:
```javascript
let hello = function() {

}
```
**can only be called after it is defined**
**visible anywhere if we define a variable and set it inside a block**

There's another way to write function expression. It is called arrow expressions
Syntax:
```javascript
let hello = () => {

}
```
